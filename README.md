# Mharo Vyapaar

**OBJECTIVE**


About 600 Million farmers in INDIA are the financial bedrock of our country. But we still suffer from poor economic model and failed implementation of agricultural regulations.


**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
Mharo Vaiyypar is evolution of the  basic community-supported agriculture model, which takes advantage of the blockchainâ€™s potential for distributed accord, token-based equity shares and automatic governance so as to foster larger community engagement whereas removing a number of the social control burdens and monetary risks from farmers concerned in an exceedingly CSA. The goal is to come back to the basic goals of the initial CSAs: to form new kinds of property possession, community cooperation, and regionally independent economies.

Mharo Vaiyypar differs from each original and modern community-supported agriculture in many key ways that. instead ofoperational as one farm, Mharo Vaiyypar is a platform for entire communities to form a parallel economy for the assembly, processing, distribution, and consumption of native food. moreover, shares aren't purchased earlier than time at a flat fee, however rather earned by supporting and tributary to the native food system. Shares could also be issued for volunteering on the farm, transporting food, tributary to a crowdfunding campaign, sharing process instrumentation, taking part in an academic workshop, and anything a community assigns worth to. Shares could also be changedfor food from a network of farmers markets, co-op stores, specialty markets, restaurants and food pantries


**IDEA & IMPLEMENTATION**

This project demonstrates the *POC* that using blockchain a platform can be built which can bridge the gap between farmers and the Market.
This platform can serve the cause of building a decentralized community amongst the Farmers.

Building a community will help building all kind of income under one roof. Having a decentralized community help make a permanent and free web accessible to the farmer as well as the customer.

- building a webApp and Connect farmers to the market.
- Proof of Reputation Model
- Democratising the Agricultural End.
- Regularize prices based ion market.

Project is Implementated on *Ethereum Blockchain* and *Smart Contracts* and is deployed on *JavaScript VM and TestRPC*

**HOW IT WORK?**

This project is Written in 

- AngularJS
- Web3
- TruffleFramework
- Solidity


Getting Started is simple with a Basic frontend which will tell the farmer how much money he has and how much reputation he has gained by community services.the reputation will better help the farmer in need. Being a decentralized model of web the farmer doesn't need to pay any extra charge for using. Using this kind of service will eliminate all kind of middle man service and connect the farmer to the market where tjhe farmer can ask for the price he wants in exchange of the fees paid for delivery and maintanace to the market which will also be taken care by someone and hence gaining reputation points by them.This will create a self sustainable model maitained by the farmer community. This will intern help the govenrment maitain a complete database of how much of agricultural production is being done without any external or middle man requirement. This will lead to a better governance amongst the community.

Another Major advantage is reducing the Infaltion rate in the market due to middle man hoarding.

**PROGRESS**

- Smart Contracts (build & passing)
- Community WebApp (built)
- Token (Partial built)
- hosting (localHost & Ethereum Remix)
- Proof of Reputation (built & complete)
- Market WebApp (Partial & to be tested)

**FUTURE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT**

- Machine Learning Model to suggest prices (Farmers)
- Machine Learning Model to decide the best product (Consumer)
- using IPFS(Inter Planetary File System) to store all Market data.
